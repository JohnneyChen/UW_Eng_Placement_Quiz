FE:
- Fix the way the accordion works: right now it doesn't collapse when another question is selected

- Figure out how to make checkboxes rounded

- Response page

- If industry isnt selected on the quiz, the model breaks

BE:
- data and response storage

Data:
- Data explorations
- Exploratory data analysis
- Model selection
- Model building
- ranked choices
- performance improvements

Design:
- form
- pre-form landing page?
- post-form landing page/response page
- program definition & exploration page

Open Questions:
- How to score models?
  -Old FYDP team  did 5 fold validation for cross fold validation
  -Leave one out is a more consistent and more easy to explain

Old model:
- old model is built on deprecated code. I can't run it and make it work easily. This means that we wont be able to compare each of our models to each of the previous models ourselves for a 1:1 comparison. We have to rely on their data. I could potentially fix it with a sprint or two dedicated to refactoring their codebase,  but I don't see the value.
- Old team experimented with decision trees, associations, and naive bayes


on deploy:
- set model_name somewhere?
- copy model?
- copy data_load?
- copy dictionaries.py?
- maybe move model building into poc?

Add New Model:
- Add quiz_data.csv, exported_model_files, data_load, and dictionaries to quiz folder under poc
- Rename imports to include from . "file" import *
- Add poc/quiz/ to retrieve all filenames
- Update model name

UPDATES:

Decision tree update:
- test_vector got nano with naive bayes, tron with decision trees
- Decision trees give no probability for anything other than the one selected
- Decision tree accuracy = <33 % because of how decision trees work, value changes
