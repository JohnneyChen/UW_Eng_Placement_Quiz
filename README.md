# UW_Eng_Placement_Quiz
This was a pre-existing ML quiz project with a django back-end. During my first co-op term, I implemented features to save results to a database, query results from the SQL database using a form, and a drag and drop dashboard to represent those results in chart format. I also optimized some template logic and schemas to make the app more efficent.
