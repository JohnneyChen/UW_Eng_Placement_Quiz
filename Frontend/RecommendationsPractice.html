      <h3>Management Engineering</h3>
      <p>“Smooth moves: get a degree in making processes flow better.” Cut waiting times for surgery. Streamline supply chains. Fine-tune airline routes. 		In Canada’s first and only Management Engineering program, you’ll learn to analyze how organizations operate and apply engineering skills to increase 		their efficiency. Over the course of your degree, you’ll develop expertise in data analytics, information systems, operations and supply chain 			management, and organizational behaviour. You'll also have the opportunity to gain paid work experience through co-op. By graduation, you’ll have the 		know how to design and manage complex systems, optimizing the flow of energy, materials, people, and information. And you’ll find no shortage of 		companies looking for your skills: in software, finance, supply chain management, health care, manufacturing, and more.

      <h3>Management Engineering Compared To...</h3>
      <p>What is the difference between Management Engineering and Software Engineering?
Software Engineering applies computer science and engineering to the design of software systems. Software Engineering students take a large number of computer science and computer engineering courses at the interface of digital hardware and software, as well as core software engineering courses on software development.

In contrast, Management Engineers design, implement, and manage complex management systems. Increasingly, those management systems are implemented as software and information systems. Therefore, information/software systems design comprises a major theme area in Management Engineering, with a number of courses falling in the areas of computer science, software engineering, and information systems. In this regard, of the 13 other engineering programs offered at the University of Waterloo, only the Software Engineering and Computer Engineering programs have more such courses in their core curriculum. 

While Management Engineering students learn how to design and build basic information systems, they do not get training in low-level systems programming.  For example, a software engineering student will learn about real time systems, concurrent programming, and operating systems while Management Engineering students will not have any exposure to these topics.  Likewise, Software Engineering students do not learn about important application areas of Management Engineering such as supply chain management, operations planning, and inventory control nor do Software Engineering students learn fundamental methods such as stochastics, simulation, and optimization as part of their core curriculum. 

Simply put, Management Engineering students learn to solve large real-world problems of businesses and organizations that are implemented in software, while Software Engineering students learn to solve a wide range of software problems including low-level systems programming.</p>
